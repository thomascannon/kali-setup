# Kali Customisation Script

This script idea was originally taken from https://github.com/Raikia/Kali-Setup/ and I claim no credit for it!

It has been refactored and customised to my needs, including many new installer modules

Example of customising a fresh Kali install with common mobile security tools:

`./run.py mobile_setup.ini`

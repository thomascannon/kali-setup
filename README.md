# Kali Customisation Script

This script idea was originally taken from https://github.com/Raikia/Kali-Setup/.  I do not claim credit for the basis of the script!

I have refactored it and customised it to my needs, which is mainly to build a clean Kali image for Mobile Security training classes.
